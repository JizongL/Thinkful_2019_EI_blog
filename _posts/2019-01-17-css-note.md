## CSS the right way
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
 HTML is about structure and content (aka, the "content layer"), CSS is about style and appearance.

 The key vocabulary words for CSS are: ruleset, selector, declaration block, declarations, property, and value.

commenting in css
`/* valid */`






CSS Selectors

The selector here (p::first-letter - note the double colon) is a pseudo-element.

This is an example of inline styling and it is to be avoided

Engineers refer to this as maintaining the separation of concerns between HTML and CSS.


the browser will choose the rule with higher specificity.

Cascading
The cascade is a process browsers follow to determine which CSS values get applied for all the properties on a given element.

To determine which property-value pairs to apply to a particular element, the browser

Determines which rules apply to the element
Takes all the relevant rulesets and sorts them according to their origin (for instance, inline styles vs. external stylesheets — inline styles win over external) and importance (more on importance in a moment)
Takes all rulesets that have same origin and importance and sorts them by selector specificity
If there are still conflicting values for rulesets with the same importance, origin, and specificity, applies the ruleset that was declared last.

keyword !important(do not use it easily)

CSS resets or CSS normalization to ensure a consistent experience across browsers.

 Though box-sizing has three possible values (content-box, padding-box, and border-box), the most popular value is border-box.



pseudo class

```css

div.foo:hover{
  background-color: orange;
}

p::first-letter {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: red;
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

Tinting

Element selectors (e.g., p {...})
Combination selectors (e.g., .foo.bar {...})
Multi selectors (e.g., .foo, .bar {...})
Descendant selectors (e.g., .foo li {...})
Direct child selectors (e.g., .foo > li {...})
Before and after pseudo-elements selectors (e.g., li::before {...})
Anchor pseudo-classes (e.g., a:hover {...})
Attribute selectors (e.g., input[type="text"] {...})

```
a:link {
  /* unvisited link */
}

a:visited {
  /* visited link */
}

a:hover {
  /* mouse over link */
}

a:focus {
  /* keyboard focus on link */
}


a:active {
  /* selected link (i.e., you've clicked
    but not released on the link)
 */
}

a:link {
  color: purple;
}

a:hover,
a:focus {
  font-size: 20px;
}

a:visited {
  color: orange;
}

a:active {
  color: black;
}

```


`aside p {
  /* make rules */
}`


`aside > p {
  /* make rules */
}`


```
/* key-like styles used by

kbd {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0 .1em;
  padding: .1em .6em;
  font-family: Arial,"Helvetica Neue",Helvetica,sans-serif;
  font-size: 11px;
  line-height: 1.4;
  color: #242729;
  text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #FFF;
  background-color: #e1e3e5;
  border: 1px solid #adb3b9;
  border-radius: 3px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(12,13,14,0.2), 0 0 0 2px #FFF inset;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

```

Exact match: element[attribute=value]
Match pattern anywhere in value: element[attribute*=value]
Match pattern at beginning of value: element[attribute^=value]
Match pattern at end of value: element[attribute$=value]

## CSS layout
` margin: auto`
When you need to *horizontally center block-level content* relative to a parent element, margin: auto is your friend.
works only for block-level elements




### Inline elements
An inline element – for example, a, strong, em, or span – doesn't start on a new line and usually does not contain additional elements, but instead just contains text

another definition =>(An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.)

The following works with inline elements centering.

`text-align: center;`
`text-shadow`

[Check out this link](https://repl.it/@thinkful/text-aligncenter-example) for example.


[Check out this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

You can change the visual presentation of an element using the CSS display property. For example, by changing the value of `display` from "inline" to "block"

[check this example out](https://repl.it/@JizongL/Inline-elements-example-1)

### Block-level elements


 block-level elements will take up the entire width of whatever element they appear inside of, but we can override this by explicitly setting the `width` or `max-width` property on an element.

[Check out this example](https://repl.it/@thinkful/block-level-elements-example)

[list of block level elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#Elements)



### inline-block element
An inline-block element displays inline like a span or a element, but you can give it an explicit width, height, margin, and padding.

we've set their width to 25%, together, they take up 100% of the width of their parent (the <main> element).

`display: inline-block;`

[Inline-block element example](https://repl.it/@JizongL/Inline-block-example-1)

## The position property
The `position` property is all about the flow of elements in an HTML document.

e.g: `statics` and `fixed`

```

.foo {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: fixed;
  background-color: blue;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
}

```
CSS gives us four offset properties: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`. These properties can be used on elements whose position is set to `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute`, but not static.

In the first paragraph, "foo" and "bar" have no white space because the spans are right next to each other. In the second paragraph, however, there's a space between "bizz" and "bang" because the browser interprets the line break between the two spans as a space.

also look at [codepen demo](https://codepen.io/JizongL/pen/REXogY)


[flexboxfroggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

### Absolute
We just said that an absolute element's offsets are in relation to the first parent element that has a [non-static position](https://repl.it/@JizongL/Absolute-position-example-3).

In this example, we've set `text-align`: right on the nav element, in order to get the links to align to the right. In order to get the kitten logo to align to the left, we set its position to absolute and then use a left offset so it doesn't run directly against the left border of the nav.

Check out this [post](http://learnlayout.com/position-example.html) to solidify understanding of `position`.

## float

`clear` to clear, it follows immediate after a float element.
check out [this](https://repl.it/@JizongL/float-and-clear-example-2) to solidify understanding.

The primary use case for floats is getting text to wrap around an image (or some other container).

`float: left;`

[example of float](https://repl.it/@JizongL/Float-example-1)

`clear: right`
The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float.

*caution*
there are also many examples of floats being used to achieve layouts that would be better achieved by using display: inline-block;. Our advice for you at this point in your learning is to use floats only when you need to wrap text around an element.

## quiz
* Describing the different parts of a CSS ruleset (the selector, the declaration block, declarations, properties, values)

selector-give you precise control over the elements targeted by a declaration block.n addition to element, class, and id selectors, there are also pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

declaration block-The declaration block follows the selector. A declaration block is a set of declarations contained in curly brackets ({, }). Within the block, each line is a separate declaration.

declarations/property/value-A declaration consists of a property and the value it is to be set to.Each property has a range of valid values


* Explaining what is meant when people say CSS is about presentation (vs. structure or behavior)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the presentation layer. Whereas HTML is about structure and content (aka, the "content layer"), CSS is about style and appearance



* Explaining the box model
The total space taken up by an element is determined by its width, height, padding, border, and margin

<img src="https://tf-curricula-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/curricula/6e8033080cefd638fd9ad37c3b230d99/WEB-DEV-001/v1/assets2/1.3.1_anatomy_of_css/box-model-1.png">

To calculate the measurements for an element, we add width, plus 2x padding, plus 2x border, plus 2x margin.

```
.foo {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid green;
  margin: 30px;
}
```
the above is 222px
